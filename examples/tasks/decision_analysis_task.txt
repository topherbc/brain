Given the following scenario, analyze the decision-making process and potential outcomes:

A robot must navigate through a maze with three paths:
Path A: Shortest but requires crossing unstable terrain
Path B: Longest but completely stable
Path C: Medium length with unknown terrain

Constraints:
- Battery life: 3 hours
- Must carry a fragile payload
- Cannot backtrack once path is chosen

Requirements:
- Risk assessment for each path
- Probability of success calculations
- Decision tree analysis
- Optimal path recommendation
- Alternative strategies
